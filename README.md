## Responsive vs mobile-first design
> Mobile first is the new RESPONSIVE

**Responsive** It is used to describe the possibility of websites adapting to various output devices. The layout, fonts, image sizes etc. change and or scale according to the size of the browser. This principle enables good readability and usability on desktops, tablets and smartphones. If youâ€™re reading this on a desktop, you can see the effects of the responsiveness by scaling the browser window. Make it very narrow to simulate the look of this site on a smartphone.

**Mobile first** is an approach to responsive design: design for smaller screens first, then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens. This design approach is also known as "progressive enhancement.
